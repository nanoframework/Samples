### Welcome to the **nanoFramework** team code samples repository!


This repo contains code samples used by the team when testing, working on proof of concepts for new and improved features and other explorational endeavours.
Feel free to browse, take what you like and contribute back if you want.

> Note: sometimes it's convenient to reference the source code instead of the NuGet packages in projects that require debugging by following the execution flow into other projects or even class libraries. For that we recommend using a very handy Visual Studio extension that allows NuGet assembly references to project references switching. That's [NuGet Reference Switcher](https://github.com/rsuter/NuGetReferenceSwitcher).

### Sample list

* [ADC](ADC) it's a sample solution to test reading voltages from the board ADC hardware.
* [Blinky](Blinky) is a basic "Hello world" app that blinks an LED.
* [DebugGC.Test](DebugGC.Test) is a sample solution for testing GC messages output.
* [Gpio+Events.Test](Gpio+Events.Test) is a sample project that constantly blinks an LED and turns another LED on/off reacting to the state of a button.
* [RTC Sample](RTC) it's a sample solution for testing RTC related stuff.
* [SerialCommunication sample](/SerialCommunication) it's a sample solution for testing sending/receiving data using an UART (COM port).
* [System.Random](System.Random) it's a basic sample that shows how to use the various APIs to generate random numbers.
* [Timer sample](/Timer) it's a sample solution for testing timers and their callbacks.
* [ToString Test](ToStringTest) is a sample solution for testing `ToString()` with integers, floats and doubles.
