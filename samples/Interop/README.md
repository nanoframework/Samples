# Interop sample

This project illustrates the use of the 'Interop' feature which allow a C# manage API to call native code.

There are two Solutions in this sample:

- In the [*awesome-library*](awesome-library/) folder you'll find the solution with the Interop library: `NF.AwesomeLib.sln`.
- In the [*test-application*](test-application/) folder you'll find the test application that is referencing the Interop library: `Test.Interop.sln`.
