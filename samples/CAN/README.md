# CAN sample

Shows how to use the [nanoFramework.Devices.Can](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/nanoFramework.Devices.Can.html) API to read and write from/to a Can device.


> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of nanoFramework feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access any shared dependencies. 
<!-- For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center.  -->
