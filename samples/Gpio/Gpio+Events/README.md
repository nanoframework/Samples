# GPIO and events sample

Shows how to use the [Windows.Devices.Gpio]((http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/Windows.Devices.Gpio.html) API allowing your to set and read the state of GPIO pins.


> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of nanoFramework feature samples. 
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access any shared dependencies.
