# üå∂Ô∏è - ESP32 Pulse Counter sample

Shows how to use the [ESP32 Pulse Counter](https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFramework.Hardware.Esp32/blob/main/nanoFramework.Hardware.Esp32/Gpio/Gpio%E2%80%8BPulseCounter.cs) API allowing your count pulses on GPIO pins.

- Create a specific Pulse Count GPIO pins
- Read counter of input GPIO pins

## Hardware requirements

Any hardware device running a nanoFramework image built with GPIO support enabled.

### Samples

Pulse counter allows to count pulses without having to setup a GPIO controller and events. It's a fast way to get count during a specific amount of time. This pulse counter allows as well to use 2 different pins and get a pulse count depending on their respective polarities.

### Pulse Counter with 1 pin

The following code illustrate how to setup a counter for 1 pin:

```csharp
GpioPulseCounter counter = new GpioPulseCounter(26);
counter.Polarity = GpioPulsePolarity.Rising;
counter.FilterPulses = 0;

counter.Start();
int inc = 0;
GpioPulseCount counterCount;
while (inc++ < 100)
{
    counterCount = counter.Read();
    Console.WriteLine($"{counterCount.RelativeTime}: {counterCount.Count}");
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
}

counter.Stop();
counter.Dispose();
```

The counter will always be positive and incremental. You can reset to 0 the count by calling the `Reset` function:

```csharp
GpioPulseCount pulses = counter.Reset();
// pulses.Count contains the actual count, it is then put to 0 once the function is called
```

### Pulse Counter with 2 pins

This is typically a rotary encoder scenario. In this case, you need 2 pins and they'll act like in this graphic:**

You can then use a rotary encoder connected to 2 pins:

![rotary encoder](https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFramework.IoT.Device/blob/develop/devices/RotaryEncoder/RotaryEncoder.Sample_bb.png?raw=true)

The associated code is the same as for 1 pin except in the constructor:

```csharp
GpioPulseCounter encoder = new GpioPulseCounter(12, 14);
encoder.Start();
int incEncod = 0;
GpioPulseCount counterCountEncode;
while (incEncod++ < 100)
{
    counterCountEncode = encoder.Read();
    Console.WriteLine($"{counterCountEncode.RelativeTime}: {counterCountEncode.Count}");
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
}

encoder.Stop();
encoder.Dispose();
```

As a result, you'll get positives and negative pulses.
