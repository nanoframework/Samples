# WiFi Soft AP sample

Shows how to use various APIs related with WiFi Soft AP.

### Starts a Soft AP (Hot spot) and runs a simple web server to configure the Wireless connection parameters.

The sample uses GPIO pin 5 to switch back into the SoftAP configuration mode. When pulled to ground on boot will switch into Soft AP mode.  
You can connect to the web server via the url http://192.168.4.1/

Once you save the wireless configuration the next boot the device will automatically connect to that Access Point
and the Soft AP will be disabled.
