# 🌶️🌶️ - HTTP sample pack

Shows how to use the HTTP related APIs in [System.Net](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/System.Net.html).

Please note that samples are offered in "pairs": one for wired connected targets and another one for Wi-Fi connected targets.

## Scenarios

### HTTP listener

[🌶️🌶️ - Http Listener](./HttpListener) on how to implement a HTTP listener to reply to incoming HTTP requests.
[🌶️🌶️ - Http Listener with wifi](./HttpListener_Wifi) on how to implement a HTTP listener to reply to incoming HTTP requests for Wi-Fi connected targets..

> **Note:** this is **NOT** an HTTP server, just a sample to illustrate how to use the HTTP Listener class.  

### HTTP Web Request

[🌶️🌶️ - Http Web Request](./HttpWebRequest) on how to perform a HTTP Web requests. Optionally to secured (TLS) servers.
[🌶️🌶️ - Http Web Request with wifi](./HttpWebRequest_Wifi) on how to perform a HTTP Web requests for Wi-Fi connected targets. Optionally to secured (TLS) servers.

### HTTP Azure Get

Illustrates how to connect to [🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Azure and perform GET requests](./HttpAzureGET).
Illustrates how to connect to [🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Azure and perform GET requests with wifi](./HttpAzureGET_Wifi) for Wi-Fi connected targets.

### HTTP Azure POST

Illustrates how to connect to [🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Azure and perform POST requests](./HttpAzurePOST).
Illustrates how to connect to [🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Azure and perform POST requests with wifi](./HttpAzurePOST) for Wi-Fi connected targets.

## Hardware requirements

An hardware device with networking capabilities running a nanoFramework image.
This sample is coded to use the STM32F769IDiscovery target board, but can be easily changed to any other target that has networking capabilities.

> NOTE: When working with a target with Wi-Fi capabilities, make sure to add `HAS_WIFI` into the DefineConstants, like this:

```text
<DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);HAS_WIFI;</DefineConstants>
```
