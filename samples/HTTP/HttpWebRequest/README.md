# üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è - HTTP WebRequest sample

Shows how to use the HTTP related APIs in [System.Net](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/System.Net.html). Shows how to perform a HTTP Web requests. Optionally to secured (TLS) servers.

The sample is [located here](./Program.cs).

When working with ESP32 edit the nfproj files and add `BUIID_FOR_ESP32` to the DefineConstants, like this:

```text
<DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);BUIID_FOR_ESP32;</DefineConstants>
```

> **Important**: You need to have a good understanding of certificates to be able to properly write code using SSL with a specific certificate. We do recommend you to get some knowledge about this before trying to adjust the sample without knowing which certificate to use.

## Hardware requirements

An hardware device with networking capabilities running a nanoFramework image.
This sample is coded to use the STM32F769IDiscovery target board, but can be easily changed to any other target that has networking capabilities.
