# 🌶️ - UdpClient sample pack

Shows how to use UdpClient API in various situations.

## Hardware requirements

An hardware device running a nanoFramework image with networking capabilities enabled.

## Samples provided

Three samples are provided:

- [🌶️ - QOTDClient](./QOTDClient/Program.cs) : show how to use `UdpClient` as an udp client. It connect to a public `Quote of the day` server and display the result.
- [🌶️ - UdpEchoServer](./UdpEchoServer/Program.cs) : show how to use `UdpClient` as an udp server. It implements a simple Udp server that listen to messages and echo them back to the sender. You need a companion sender application to test it. The `Sender.ipynb` notebook in the folder can be used with .net interactive in vscode to send messages to the server ([check this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) on how to proceed).
