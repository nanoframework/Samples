#### Graphics Samples

##### Overview
These samples are provided to help explore the capabilities of the nanoFramework graphics.

You can use the graphics libraries in one of two ways

### Basic Graphics

#### Primitives
* These samples use the bitmap class which contains methods for calling the underlying code written in C.


### WPF
  >Important note : The WPF samples are still in the testing phase and require hardware buttons

   Wpf builds on the primitives using the bitmap class for the actual drawing. While the primitives are mainly written in c and embedded in the nanoframework interpreter code, Wpf is written in C#.

#### SimpleWpf
 - A program to explore some of the controls available.


#### Tetris
A program written by Pavel Banksy showing some techniques in using the nanoframework graphics.
