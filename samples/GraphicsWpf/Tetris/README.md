Tetris Demo Game for Micro Framework
====================================

_(January 28th 2008)_

This was a demo application I wrote to demonstrate different capabilities of .NET Micro Framework.
Windows Presentation Foundation, Extended Weak Reference for persistent storage etc.

This Tetris game become almost a benchmark demo for different hardware that supports .NET Micro Framework.
