# 🌶️🌶️ to 🌶️🌶️🌶️ - TLS sample pack

Shows how to use various APIs related with TLS (Transport Layer Security).

## Samples

- [🌶️🌶️ - Parsing a Certificate to access details](./ParseCertificate/)
- [🌶️🌶️ - Secure Client for Ethernet connected devices](./SecureClient/)
- [🌶️🌶️ - Secure Client for ESP32 devices (Wi-Fi connection)](./SecureClient_WiFi/)
- [🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Secure Server for Ethernet connected devices](./SecureServer/)
- [🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Secure Server for ESP32 devices (Wi-Fi connection)](./SecureServer_WiFi/)

## Test certificates

The test certificates used in the code are available in this folder.

- [X509 Certificate RSA PEM format 512 bytes](512b-rsa-example-cert.pem)
- [X509 Certificate RSA DER format 512 bytes](512b-rsa-example-cert.der)
- [X509 Certificate RSA PEM format 1024 bytes](512b-rsa-example-cert.pem)
- [X509 Certificate RSA DER format 1024 bytes](512b-rsa-example-cert.der)
- [X509 Certificate RSA PEM format 2048 bytes](512b-rsa-example-cert.pem)
- [X509 Certificate RSA DER format 2048 bytes](512b-rsa-example-cert.der)

> NOTE: if you're editing the project files, when working with a target with Wi-Fi capabilities, make sure to add `HAS_WIFI` into the DefineConstants, like this:

```text
<DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);HAS_WIFI;</DefineConstants>
```

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of nanoFramework feature samples.
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/archive/main.zip), but be
> sure to unzip everything to access any shared dependencies.
<!-- For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center.  -->

## Hardware requirements
