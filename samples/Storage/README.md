# Storage sample pack

Shows how to use the [Windows.Storage](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/Windows.Storage.html) API to access storage, create and list folders and files, read and write from/to files using text or binary data.

This sample shows how a user can create a folder and files in removable storage and files in internal flash storage.
Internal flash storage doesn't support folders.

## Scenarios

### Access Removable Devices

Lists the removable storage devices present in the target and runs the following folder and file base scenarios on the 1st drive.

### Access Internal Devices

Lists the internal storage devices present in the target and runs the following file base scenarios on the 1st drive.

### Mount a device (ESP32 Only)

Shows how to mount a SDCard device and list the folders and files.

### Create a folder

This scenario demonstrates how to create a folder in a storage device, not replacing it if it already exists.

### Create a file

This scenario demonstrates how to create a file in a folder inside a storage device.

### Write and read text to/from a file

This scenario demonstrates how to write a string to a text file and then read it back.

### Write and read binary data to/from a file

This scenario demonstrates how to write a string converted to binary formate to a binary file and then read it back.

### Create multi level folders

Shows how to create folders in multi levels.

### Create files in a folder

This scenario goes further than the Create a file scenario to create multiple files in a low level folder.

### Rename a folder

This scenario demonstrates how to rename a folder.

### Delete FIles and Folders

This scenario demonstrates how delete files and folder with a recursive method to delete a whole folder tree.

### Rename files

This scenario demonstrates how to rename a file.

### Un-mount SDCard

This scenario demonstrates how to un-mount a mounted drive (ESP32)

### Subscribe to Removable Devices event handlers

This scenario demonstrates how to subscribe event handlers for Removable Devices events to be notified when a storage device is inserted and removed.

## Hardware requirements

Any hardware device running a nanoFramework image built with support for Windows.Storage device (SD card or USB mass storage device).
