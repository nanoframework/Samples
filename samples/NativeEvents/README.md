# Native events sample

Shows how to use the [CustomEvent](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/nanoFramework.Runtime.Events.CustomEvent.html) class that allows to post events from the native code to the managed application.

> **Note:** This sample is part of a large collection of nanoFramework feature samples.
> If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/archive/master.zip), but be
> sure to unzip everything to access any shared dependencies.
<!-- For more info on working with the ZIP file, 
> the samples collection, and GitHub, see [Get the UWP samples from GitHub](https://aka.ms/ovu2uq). 
> For more samples, see the [Samples portal](https://aka.ms/winsamples) on the Windows Dev Center.  -->
