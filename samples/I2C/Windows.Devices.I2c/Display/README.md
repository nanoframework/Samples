# I2C sample

Shows how to use the [Windows.Devices.I2c](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/Windows.Devices.I2c.html) API to read and write from/to an I2C device.
In this sample we'll be using a [STMPE811](https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/s/stmicroelectronics/stmpe811) resistive touchscreen controller mounted in a [STM32F429I DISCOVERY](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html) board.

The sample project includes a minimal driver for the STMPE811.
It configures the touchscreen controller and the GPIO pin where the INT signal of the controller is connected allowing the code to react to a touch event rather then wasting CPU by constantly pooling the touch detection.

Following a touch event (and as long as the screen is pressed) the console outputs the coordinates of the touch point.

## Hardware requirements

An [STM32F429I DISCOVERY](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html) board.
The code sample is demonstrative of the use of the I2C API.

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the subfolder for this specific sample. Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution.

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging.
