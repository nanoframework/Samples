# 🌶️🌶️ - I2C Scanner sample

Shows how to use the [System.Device.I2c](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/System.Device.I2c.html) API to scan the I2C bus.

This sample uses the specificity of `Write` and `Read` function returning an `I2cTransferResult` structure.

When running the code, you'll get output in debug that will look like this:

```text
0x0E Write: 4, transferred: 0, Read: 2, transferred: 0
0x0E - Absent
0x0F Write: 4, transferred: 0, Read: 2, transferred: 0
0x0F - Absent
0x10 Write: 1, transferred: 1, Read: 1, transferred: 1
0x10 - Present
0x11 Write: 4, transferred: 0, Read: 2, transferred: 0
0x11 - Absent
```

The first part is the I2C device address and then you'll get the status of a write and a read. A successful read or write has the status result as `I2cTransferStatus.FullTransfer`. Any other result means that there is an issue. The number of bytes transferred should be 1 in both cases.

> Note: you can adjust the code to validate only read or write, some devices, may require specific write before being able to read them. In general, writing only is sufficient in the bus.

## Hardware requirements

Any device with I2C in the firmware. The sample is built specifically for ESP32 devices. If you are using a STM32 or anything else, comment the 2 Configuration lines and remove the Hardware.Esp32 nuget.
