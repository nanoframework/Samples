# 🌶️🌶️🌶️ - Complete Azure MQTT sample using BMP280 sensor **without Azure lib** and with deep sleep

Shows how to use M2Mqtt library with Azure IoT measuring a BMP280 sensor. This leverages the [nanoFramework.IoT.Device](https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFramework.IoT.Device) repository.

The sample is [located here](./).

## Hardware requirements

An hardware device with networking capabilities running a nanoFramework image. 
This code has been tested with ESP32 boards. Note that there is a specific section to enable serial port logging. This can be replaced by any other board with networking capabilities.

The sample uses wifi, this part can be as well replaced with an ethernet connection. It will work the exact same way.

> [!Important]
>
> In this sample, if the connection or something is not setup properly you won't be able to debug properly. Please make sure you are using another sample to understand how Azure Client with a sample and deep sleep is working before using this one.

### Reference

- [nanoFramework.IoT.Device Bmxx80 devices](https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFramework.IoT.Device/tree/develop/devices/Bmxx80).
- [Azure IoT documentation for MQTT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-mqtt-support).

## Build the sample

1. Simply adjust the device IoT Hub elements and your network.
1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio 2019 (Visual Studio 2017 should be OK too) and select `File > Open > Project/Solution`.
1. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples/cloned the repository, go to the subfolder for this specific sample. Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B`, or select `Build > Build Solution`.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select `Build > Deploy Solution`.

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select `Debug > Start Debugging`.

**Important**: You can debug this sample only for one cycle as the device will very quickly go to sleep. If you want to debug, comment the part where it goes to sleep and replace with and infinite thread sleep timeout or a loop to once of the previous part of the code.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Important**: Before deploying or running the sample, please make sure your device is visible in the Device Explorer.
>
> **Tip**: To display the Device Explorer, go to Visual Studio menus: `View > Other Windows > Device Explorer`.
