# NeoPixel Strip WS2812 with RMT

Shows how to use ESP32 RMT with an NeoPixel Strip WS2812

This sample send signal to strip with pin D5.

**Connections**  
GIN -  Any available GPIO pin (D5 in the sample)
GND -  Ground signal  
+5V - External Power Supply 5V min 2A  

**Notes**:  
- Put resistor 400 Ohm between GIN and GPIO pin  
- Join the ground of the external power supply and the GND of ESP32 
- This example require a preview firmware dont use *-stable* parameter on *nanoff*
