# 🌶️🌶️ - Hardware ESP32 RMT sample pack

Shows how to use the [nanoFramework.Hardware.Esp32.Rmt](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/nanoFramework.Hardware.Esp32.Rmt.html) 
API to access the ESP32 RMT functions.

The RMT(remote control) is primarily used to send and receive remote control commands but due to its flexibilty it can be used to generate and recieve many types of signals.
