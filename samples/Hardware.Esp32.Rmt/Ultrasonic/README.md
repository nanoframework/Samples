# 🌶️🌶️ - Ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor with RMT

Shows how to use ESP32 RMT with an Ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor

This sample initializes the SR04 device and sends 10us pulses and then measures the width of the received pulse to calculate the distance in meters.
The sample contains a SR04 class which can be used directly in your own applications.

The SR04 has 4 pins.

The sample is [located here](./Program.cs).

## Connections

- VCC -  5V or 3.3V depending on version of SR04
- GND -  Ground signal
- TRIG - Any available GPIO pin capable of output
- ECHO - Any available GPIO pin

> Note: When connecting ECHO to ESP32 pin be aware that if using a 5v version of SR04 a level shifter should be used.
OK for short tests but for long term use connect a resistor between SR04 output and ESP32 pin(10K) to limit current.

## Hardware requirements

Any ESP32 hardware device running a nanoFramework image with HC-SR04P 3.3V version ( HC-SR04 5v version )
