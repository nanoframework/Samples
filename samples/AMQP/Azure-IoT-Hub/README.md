# 🌶️🌶️ -Azure AMQP sample

Shows how to use AMQP.Net Lite library.

The sample is [located here](./Program.cs).

## Hardware requirements

An hardware device with networking capabilities running a nanoFramework image. This code has been tested with a SMT32F769IDISCOVERY board.

## TLS connection to Azure IoT Hub

To use a secured (TLS) connection to Azure IoT Hub the following is required:

1. Upload the root CA certificate for Azure. That's the "Baltimore CyberTrust Root". You can download it from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes#what-is-changing). It should be uploaded to the device using the Network Configuration dialog from Device Explorer.

1. Set the `Connection.DisableServerCertValidation` to `false`.

1. Generate an SAS Token for your device. [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer) it's a convenient tool to do this for you.
After setting up the access to you IoT Hub, navigate to the device, enter the desired parameters and generate the SAS Token (see the print screen below).
