# MQTT sample pack

The M2Mqtt library provides a main class `MqttClient` that represents the MQTT client to connect to a broker. You can connect to the broker providing its IP address or host name and optionally some parameters related to MQTT protocol.

After connecting to the broker you can use `Publish()` method to publish a message to a topic and `Subscribe()` method to subscribe to a topic and receive message published on it. The `MqttClient` class is events based so that you receive an event when a message is published to a topic you subscribed to. You can receive event when a message publishing is complete, you have subscribed or unsubscribed to a topic.

For more details, see the comments inside the samples.
