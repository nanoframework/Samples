# 🌶️ - Blink your first led

Shows how to use the [System.Device.Gpio](http://docs.nanoframework.net/api/System.Device.Gpio.html) API to set GPIO pins.

The sample is [located here](./Blinky/Program.cs).

## Hardware requirements

Any hardware device running a nanoFramework image.

Some boards like most of the ESP32 dev kits and most of the STM32 boards have an embedded led. You can use it to test this code. You just need to understand the GPIO number and use if in this sample.
